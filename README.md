# Features:
- do /helicamcontrols while in a Police Maverick Helicopter for the list of controls

# Issues:
- Performance issue from constantly drawing the boxes on the thermal cam (Unresolvable as far as I can work out)
- Meter distance doesnt show when locked on (Unresolvable, maybe a restructure could fix this)

# Bugs: None Known
