# DOESN'T WORK PROPERLY ANYMORE SO DON'T USE! I WILL HAVE A NEW VERSION SOON
# Helicopter FLIR Camera
Realistic FiveM Helicopter Forward-Looking Infrared Camera heavily based on a real US police heads up display.

# Showcase Video:

# Features:
- do /helicamcontrols while in a Police Maverick Helicopter for the list of controls

# Issues:
- Performance issue from constantly drawing the boxes on the thermal cam (Unresolvable as far as I can work out)
- Meter distance doesnt show when locked on (Unresolvable, maybe a restructure could fix this)
- Boxes don't draw on all entities when theres a lot of them (Unresolvable as far as I can work out, seems to be a game limitation)

# Bugs:
- Nightvision and the black overlay of the thermal cam don't appear. Restarting the resource can fix it but probably best just not to use the resource anymore.
