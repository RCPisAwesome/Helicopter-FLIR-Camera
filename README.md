# Helicopter FLIR Camera
Realistic FiveM Helicopter Forward-Looking Infrared Camera heavily based on a real US police heads up display.

# Showcase Video:

# Features:
- do /helicamcontrols while in a Police Maverick Helicopter for the list of controls

# Issues:
- Performance issue from constantly drawing the boxes on the thermal cam (Unresolvable as far as I can work out)
- Meter distance doesnt show when locked on (Unresolvable, maybe a restructure could fix this)
- Boxes don't draw on all entities when theres a lot of them (Unresolvable as far as I can work out, seems to be a game limitation)

# Bugs:

- Nightvision and the black overlay of the thermal cam don't appear. This might be an issue from other scripts. Restarting the resource fixes it but cause is unknown. Seems to only be a recent bug, FiveM might've just fucked something.
